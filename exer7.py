# Exercise 7
# More Printing
# Literally just practice typing printing
# at this point in my studies I am very familiar with this
# I will do it for the practice so I can become great

# watch that comma at the end, experiment with moving it to see what happens
# I'm using Python 3 where the comma no longer connects to lines
# in order to get the same effect you have to add 'end=""' to stop
# the print function from going to the next line
# good to know
