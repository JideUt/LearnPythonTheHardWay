# a review of all we learned so far
# instructions are to go through each exercise and write down every
# word and symbol that we used



# import - to take a module from a package, which is existing code that is shared
# the random package - a popular one that produces random letters, numbers,etc
# for loop and variables
# global variables - variables declared outside of a function
# local variable - declared inside a function, therefore only usable in the function
# strings - set inside of quotations and can be printed to the terminal
# integers - numbers and can be used to perform calculations
# floating point - decimals in python
# concatenation - adding strings together or joining data together
# Operators - ' +, -, /, *, //, %, =, **, >, <' to perform operations 
	# on variables and values, logical, membership, bitwise, etc.
# Logical Operators - and, or, not
# Identity Operators - is, is not
# modulus operandi - % which can be used in format strings and
	# can be used to get the remainder in a calculations
# // - floor division rounds the result to the nearest whole
# format strings - uses % and "d, r, s" to insert variables from outside
	# the string... d is for numbers, r inserts the raw data, and s for string
# print - builtin python function to display to the terminal
	# this is a none function so it does not have a values
# return - returns a value to a function or variable, to become an object
# modules - certain function, typically when imported from a package
# \ - "escape character" used to break in a string. 
	#example \n is new line, \t is  tab, \r carriage return
# f string - not shown in LPTHW but I know its a different way to do a format string
# Booleans - builtin data type... used to represent the truth of a value
	#often used to continue running loops and even to signal start or stop of api
# """ - triple quotations allow you to have a string across multiple lines
# input() - builtin function to take user input through the terminal
#argv - a module from the sys package, that allows you to take multiple
	# arguments in the terminal/commandline
# script - another name for the program you write. the script is an arguments
	# passed through powershell, or terminal, or commandline
# open() - builtin function to open files which creates an object that
	# can be set to a variable
# function - a block of code that only runs when it is called
	#you can put data into functions through parameters
