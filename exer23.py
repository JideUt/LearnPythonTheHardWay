# This lesson focuses on reading code so I can learn:
	# How to find Python Source Code for things I need
	# Reading through the code and looking for files
	# Trying to understand the code I find
	
# go on github and type python
# try and understand the script with what knowledge you have
# went on github and looked at a blackjack game and an assembler
# I understood all of the blackjack code although I admit I didn't
    #fully understand how they would know to do so many if statements
    # or why that many were necessary
    
# the assembler I understood the use of many terms and characters
    # including the use of classes and decorators, but I couldn't
    # tell what it was meant to do.
