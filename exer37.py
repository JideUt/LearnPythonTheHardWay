# Finally done the project of Exercise 36!
# This lesson is going over all of the symbols and pythonic words learned so far
# It's a review like the title implies

#with is an interesting statement that I have never used - a google search
    # suggested that it's used in context situations
    # an example is with open(filename, 'r') as variable:
# A lot of the symbols, keywords, and operators in this exercise are new or unknown
# to me. Example - \a %i %o %u lambda etc.
